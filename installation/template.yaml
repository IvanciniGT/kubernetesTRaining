# YAML is a language to structure information: JSON or XML

# One YAML file can contain multiple YAML documents
# Documents are separated from each other by using ---
---
# With this hash char, we can supply comments
---
# One document is what we are going to call A NODE (just one)
--- 
# We have 2 types of NODES: Scalar and COLLECTIONS
---
# Scalar nodes: Represent one single value
# Numbers:

# Booleans
true # TRUE True
---
false # FALSE False
---
# Texts
We can write texts without quotes
---
'We can write texts between single quotes'
---
"We can write texts between double quotes"
---
# COLLECTIONS: ORDERED LISTS and UNORDERED MAPS
---
# Ordered Lists: Are ordered sequence of nodes
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3
- 89
- true
- 
    - subitem1
    - 2
-               - subitem1
                - 2
---
# Unordered Maps: It is an unordered sequence of nodes, each one being identified by a UNIQUE KEY
key1: item 1
key2: 89
key3: true
---
key2: 89
key1: item 1
key3: true
---
# Every single Kubernetes YAML document is an UNORDERED MAP
---
# Each program using YAML specifies its own YAML SCHEMA
# A YAML SCHEMA specifies the structure that a document should contain
# Dureing the trainng we need to learn KUBERNETES YAML SCHEMA
